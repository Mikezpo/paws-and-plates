# Paws & Plates
 This website will be an online Platform that will help the user find the perfect spot to drink a coffee with their 4 legged friend.
 In this Platform the user will be able to find Coffee shops and Restaurants that allow pets not only outside but also inside, for those rainy or cold days.
 This Platform will be focused on mainland Portugal, more specifically in the North region.

## About this project
At the moment, the website is in its very early stage, and I'll be working on it as ideas flow through my head. At this moment I want to add all the structure and create a filtering system according to different regions pre-selected by the user.
This will be a quite sizable project, and it will take quite some time to develop.
Over time as the project develops I will be adding more regions of Portugal until we cover the whole mainland, and then include the islands of Madeira and Azores as well.
